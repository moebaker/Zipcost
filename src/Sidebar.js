            <h4>This project is all about empowering underrepresented minorities to find affordable communities that match their annual salary. 
            We've developed a web app that calculates the cost of living in Miami for individuals, taking into account essential factors that determine the cost of living in any location.
            In essence, our web app is a tool that goes beyond traditional cost-of-living calculators. It's a resource that empowers individuals, especially underrepresented minorities, to make informed decisions about their residential choices based on their unique financial situations. 
            By calculating the cost of living and matching it with annual salaries, we're providing a valuable service that can positively impact lives.</h4>
