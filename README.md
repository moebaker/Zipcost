Project Overview

This project is all about empowering underrepresented minorities to find affordable communities that match their annual salary. We've developed a web app that calculates the cost of living in Miami for individuals, taking into account essential factors that determine the cost of living in any location. Here's what you need to know:

Cost of Living Calculation: Our app calculates the cost of living in Miami for users. It considers factors like housing, transportation, groceries, and more to provide an accurate estimate of the expenses they might incur.

Salary-Based Matching: The heart of our app is its ability to match users' annual salaries with affordable communities in Miami. 
Users input their salary, and the app finds the top 5 locations where they can comfortably live within their budget.

User-Friendly Interface: We've designed the app to be user-friendly and easy to navigate. Users can input their salary, and with a single click, they receive a list of the most suitable and affordable communities.

Real-time Results: The calculations are done in real-time, providing users with instant feedback. This helps them make informed decisions about where to live based on their financial situation.

Community Empowerment: Our initiative aims to empower underrepresented minorities by giving them access to crucial information about living expenses. This enables them to make informed choices about their residential location.

Scalability: While we're currently focused on Miami, the app's architecture is designed for scalability. In the future, we can expand its reach to cover more cities and regions, helping even more people.

Collaborative Development: We're fostering collaboration within our team by creating a GitHub repository. This allows developers to work together, track changes, and collectively improve the app.

Future Enhancements: In the pipeline, we're considering additional features, such as user profiles and chat functionalities. These enhancements will make the app even more interactive and engaging.

In essence, our web app is a tool that goes beyond traditional cost-of-living calculators. It's a resource that empowers individuals, especially underrepresented minorities, to make informed decisions about their residential choices based on their unique financial situations. By calculating the cost of living and matching it with annual salaries, we're providing a valuable service that can positively impact lives.
